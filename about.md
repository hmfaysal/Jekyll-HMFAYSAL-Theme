My name is **Jim Howk**, and this is my personal site.

I am a Computer Systems Engineer amongst other things. I graduated with a B.S. degree in Management Information Systems from Iowa State University in 2014 and with an A.A.S. in Computer Networks & Security from Indian Hills Community College in 2008.

This website was built with Jekyll, lots of elbow-grease, smarts, and hard work.
