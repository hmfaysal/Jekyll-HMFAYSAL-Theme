I couldn't have said it better :

Now the seasons are changing and we are looking at what the next season looks like.

Here's an excerpt:

> "I don’t know what your health goal is, but I know it won’t be perfect. Life is going to throw some challenges at you.
> When it does, don’t give up. More than that, don’t beat yourself up. If you have a broken tooth or a kid with the flu or an all-day meeting that squeezes your calendar to death, don’t worry about it.
> You can run tomorrow. Or the day after or even the week after. Running with a broken tooth isn’t noble, it’s dumb and maybe even destructive."

Lets crush our goals and encourage one another!
How can I help you reach your goal?

# Bonus &#58;

This year started out with a big jump-start!
By lunch time on January 1, 2019 I had started AND finished [The Dip - by Seth Godin]()
It packed some powerful motivation for the year and it will likely land itself on this year's top 10 must-reads list.
